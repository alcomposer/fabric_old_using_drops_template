# Road map of Fabric development

- [ ] waveform display:
  - [x] display rec head
  - [x] display play head
  - [ ] move rec head with mouse
  - [ ] move play head with mouse
  - [ ] show grains as boxes
  - [x] show spray amount as box
- [ ] volume control:
  - [ ] in volume (dry)
  - [ ] out volume (wet)
  - [ ] out volume (mix)
- [ ] Buffer controls:
  - [x] rec active (button)
  - [ ] overdub active (button)
  - [ ] clear bufer (button)  
- [x] Grain playback control:
  - [x] Density
  - [ ] Readhead speed
  - [ ] Grain length
- [ ] Grain Envelope controls:
  - [ ] Sides (taken care of with Tukey window function)
  - [ ] Tilt (moving apex left/right)
  - [ ] Curve (move from a convex - straigh - concave shape)
- [ ] Grain direction:
  - [x] forward
  - [ ] reverse
- [ ] Buffer Logic:
 - [ ] Implement circular buffer with xfade between writehead and readhead
